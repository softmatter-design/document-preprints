\begin{itembox}[l]{ABSTRACT}
	Existence of mechanical hysteresis is believed to be one of a key to achieve high durability for rubber materials.
	``Phantom Network Model'', in which fluctuation of junction point is rather high, seems to be a good candidate for micro-scale energy dissipation.
	Introducing random connectivity for network junctions, previously we successfully presented ``Phantom Network Model'' in molecular dynamics simulations.

	In this presentation, relationship of mechanical hysteresis and relaxation characteristics of ``Phantom Network Model'' was investigated.
