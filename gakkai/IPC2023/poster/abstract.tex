\begin{itembox}[l]{ABSTRACT}
	Existence of mechanical hysteresis is believed to be one of a key to achieve high durability for rubber materials.
	For hysteresis cycle, added fillers are believed to play an important roll in meso-scale region response against local stress.
	Our question is ``Is there any other mechanism to enhance durability in micro-scale region such as size of polymer chains?''.

	``Phantom Network Model'', in which fluctuation of junction point is rather high, seems to be a good candidate for micro-scale energy dissipation.
	Introducing random connectivity for network junctions, we successfully presented ``Phantom Network Model'' in molecular dynamics simulations.
